# pyPRML

### Motivation

This repository will be committed to use python, specifically the python notebook Jupyter, to implement the details of C.M.Bishop's masterpiece [PRML](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/). We'll try to implement the details, including the graph generating, as many as possible.
