# pyPRML

### Motivation

This repository will be committed to use python, specifically the python notebook Jupyter, to implement the details of C.M.Bishop's masterpiece [PRML](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/). We'll try to implement the details, including the graph generating, as many as possible.

The official webpage of this pyPRML can be found [here](https://geek-and-art.github.io/pyPRML.github.io/).

### Dataset

As the dataset is too large, it won't be uploaded to repository. Here, we only show the directory structure:

<pre>

	  - test
	    - neg
		- pos
	  - train
	    - neg
